# Prediction-of-Trait-Stability-in-Coffee

The procedure used for the prediction of trait stability in coffee was described here. 
Phenotypic file contains yield data for two populations: Premature (Prec) and Intermediate (Inter). Both populations differ by coffee bean maturity date, Prec matures earlier than Inter population. Genotypic file contains imputed ~56k snps for both populations.
The codes implemented can be found in R code. 

# Note

Before running the code, install bglr, FW, metan and dplyr R packages.
